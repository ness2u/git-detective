# Security Policy

## Supported versions
This is an early project; we aim to keep `main` stable. Please report issues against `main`.

## Reporting a vulnerability
If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please create a private, minimal reproduction and email the maintainer or open a GitHub Security Advisory (preferred) instead of a public issue.

Please include:
- A clear description of the issue and impact
- Steps to reproduce
- Any logs or output that help triage
